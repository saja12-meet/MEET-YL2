Great design, I like it. I also like that you update the clock on the screen to show what time it is - it shows that you really understand how the clock internals work in the app / phone. I really like your idea for how to implement the alarm clock - I think it might even be more efficient than the way that I decided on to implement my own alarm clock, so great job figuring it out. 

There is a problem when I try to use the app, however. The error I get when I open your app is “ Bad arguments to GetMillis. The operation GetMillis cannot accept the arguments: false “. What this implies to me is that you are trying to set the argument of GetMillis somewhere with a variable that you do not initialize to false. In fact, this is exactly what is happening from looking at your blocks editor. You use your GetMillis from the Alarmtime inside of your timer. The problem is that it looks like your timer is automatically turned on when you start the app. You also have a method to turn on the timer when you press “set alarm”, which is great. But the other thing to do that will (I think) solve your problem is set the alarm to “OFF” when the screen first initializes. 

The design looks clean and easy to use, so good job with that. It is unfortunate that this simple bug basically makes the app unusable. It is a very easy to fix, if you want to take a small amount of time to fix it and get the app working just like you want.
